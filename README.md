Using git submodule to reserve information.

## How to clone

You are recommended to clone *without* `--recurse-submodules` and use:

```sh
git submodule update --init -- XXX
```

to clone only `XXX`,

where XXX is named in form of the year of that website's creation, plus `-backend` or `-frontend`.
